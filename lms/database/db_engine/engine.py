           Asynchronous context manager for managing db_services sessions.

           This function provides a safe way to manage db_services sessions in an asynchronous application. It ensures that
           sessions are properly created, errors are handled, and sessions are closed after use.

           Yields:
               AsyncSession: An instance of the db_services session to perform db_services operations.

           Raises:
               SQLAlchemyError: If a db_services-related error occurs, it is logged and re-raised for further handling.
